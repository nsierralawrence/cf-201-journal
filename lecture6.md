At the beginning of lecture, we went over some of the feedback received from the surveys regarding the first week of classes and the purpose behind the career coaching assigments that we are required to do.  Going through information like this as a class makes me feel more confident that the Code Fellows staff is actually dedicated to constantly improving and tailoring its school toward the diverse needs of its students. The career coaching aspect in particular also demonstrates the importance the school places on the professional development and success of its students.  We then reviewed the value of creating domain object models when writing code in order to ensure its effectiveness in resolving an issue or accurately fulfilling its purpose. After breaking down the efficacy of DOMs, we went over JS object literals, demonstrating some of their puposes functions through some code examples.
