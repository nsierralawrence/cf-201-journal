At the beginning of lecture today, we reviewed the material covered readings on the image element in HTML and the color and text properties in CSS.  When reviewing the inclusion of images in HTML were advised on the proper search filters when finding images to include on a webpage, which is something I had not given much consideration before. The information regarding different types of font face, especially from an online source was super helpful.  We then covered some 'random' but very useful topics including a few helpful online resources we could use when we come across some code or issue that stumps us.  We also looked into some object oriented properties regarding strings and arrays.  This magical thing called git branching was introduced to us, which is essentially the same thing as forking, but without having to pull from an external repository into new repository, which allows us to focus on particular features of our code which we can choose to merge with the master version.
