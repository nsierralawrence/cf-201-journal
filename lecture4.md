Lecture 4 - 9.15

Prior to covering the reading material for the day, Nicholas went over some incredibly helpful bits of code, reviewing concepts such as local vs global variables, how to generate a random number using Math.random() object, how to communicate to the browser when to return certain values via the return function, and how to properly use do while loops with single data values and arrays of possible values.  This information and review was handy when revisiting bits of my own assignment code that I was stumped on.  We then went over HTML links, CSS layout properties, and some of the basics of JS functions.  Following lecture we were divided into pairs to work on pair programming assignments, fixing and refining our own JS scripts by telling our partner what, when, and where to change and add bits of code.  I found this exercise of verbalizing my thought process aloud and helping to address certain problems in my partner's code to be incredibly helpful in reinforcing a lot of the material I had trouble remembering or understanding.   I am looking forward to more opportunities to co-work on future assignments.
