At the beginning of lecture three today, we reviewed code written by a few different students for the current "About Me" questionnaire project.  I really appreciated this review because it demonstrated a few different things I could improve in my code, such as efficient ways to apply frequently applied properties across multiple blocks of HTML.  The review also demonstrated effective methods of including relevant JavaScript and CSS code documents within the HTML document.
 Following the code peer review, we reviewed different types of HTML lists, box modifications in CSS, and the ways that JavaScript flow is determined by a series of conditions and conditional statements and the various resulting loop functions.  This particular lecture turned out to be incredibly helpful in advancing my current "About Me" questionnaire code using additional conditional statements and incorporating while loops. Discussing different ways of including Boolean data highlighted the importance of carefully checking the accuracy of checking the logic of conditonal statements before attempting to run code.
